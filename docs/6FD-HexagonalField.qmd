I've been having lots of geometric dreams - I go on road trips and see ordered forests planted for harvesting in structured lattices. 

I'm standing in the middle of a hexagonal field of trees, positioned in a regular hexagonal lattice structure with side *n*. The following is an example of a hexagon field of order 5:

![](inst/HexagonalField.png){fig-align="center"}

Highlighted in green are the trees hidden from my viewpoint (red) by another tree. You can see that for a hexagonal field of order 5, 30 poitns are hidden from the centre. Let H(*n*) be the number of points hidden from the centre in a hexagonal field of order *n*. 

I give you:
H(5) = 30
H(10) = 138
H(100) = 12036

I wonder how many trees are hidden from me with H(10 000)...
